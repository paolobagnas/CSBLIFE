 Now that I am in college, I have new roles, routines, relationship, and assumptions in life. There are only few IT-GDD students in the Philippines. I should study well to be a professional at Game Design and Development.Now, I cannot always play game with my friends. I should go straight home and do my programming.I should also look at games in a different way. Instead of enjoying it, I should think on how they programmed it.
 
 
From now on, my sleeping time will be lessen because our prof said that IT - GDD students almost do not get sleep. He said that GDD is very stressful., There is no time for playing DOTA with friends in the computer shop. I also cannot go to malls and hangout with my friends. I should finish my studies first then I can go out with them when I already have a work.
 
 
As a Benildean, i will do ordinary things, Extraordinarily well. I will exert more effort in doing my works so my parents hardwork will not be wasted.I should also have a good relationship with my fellow IT - GDD blockmates because our professor said that we are only few in the Philippines so our block will be our future
Game - Making team. We should have a harmonous relationship with each other so we can do our tasks easily without having quarrels. I hope that we will work together or we will all meet in the same company. We should also have trust with one
another. I wish that all of us will keep a tight connection and communication even if we are already de-blocked.
